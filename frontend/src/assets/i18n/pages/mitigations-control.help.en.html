<h3> Measures</h3>

<p>
  This is your main tool for managing the pandemic.
  You can also decide to compensate some measures &ndash;
  meaning you will spend additional resources as compensation for affected businesses.
</p>

<p>
  To simplify, we made the state in our game extremely efficient in introducing and lifting measures.
  Everything is introduced almost immediately and there are never any technical errors.
  That is a massive simplification compared to the real world.
  Keep in mind that it takes sometime before a measure starts having an effect on the number of cases.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Measures mitigate the spread of Covid to a certain degree, but they also cost money and lower social stability.
  What strategy you choose is up to you.
  We tried to make our model as fair as possible and to allow for different approaches.
  You can try introducing and lifting measures in order to avoid new waves and running out of hospital capacity.</em>

<h3>Measures in detail</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Masks, hands, distancing</dt>
  <dd>
    a low-cost measure that slows down the spread of the disease
  </dd>

  <dt>Closing borders</dt>
  <dd>
    cross-border movement is limited to transit traffic and a few other exceptions. The measure slows down the disease, but has a negative impact on costs and social stability.
  </dd>

  <dt>Limit events</dt>
  <dd>
    measures limiting the maximum number of people gathered. It affects cultural or sporting events and various celebrations. It negatively affects the mood in society. Cancellation of events and tours translates into pandemic management costs.
  </dd>

  <dt>Services</dt>
  <dd>
    the closure of high-risk services includes restaurants, bars, gyms and similar services where there is a high risk of transmission. The next step is the closure of all shops and services, except for essentials (sale of food, fuels, etc.). Both measures reduce the rate of spread to some extent, but negatively affect costs and social stability.
  </dd>

  <dt>Schools</dt>
  <dd>
    choose which schools will be closed. It is easier for universities to shift to distance learning and the costs of closing them are lower. Elementary schools are a major contact and trasmission vector, but closing them down has a very negative effect on the costs and social stability.
  </dd>

  <dt>Lockdown</dt>
  <dd>
    leaving oneâ€™s home apart from for shopping and going to work is strictly limited. It has an extremely negative effect on social stability and maintaining it is very costly.

  </dd>

  <dt>Extra compensation</dt>
  <dd>
    the government is already providing financial support to affected sectors. This measure will increase this compensation significantly and cause stability to decrease less or even increase.
