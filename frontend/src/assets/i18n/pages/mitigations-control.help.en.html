<h3>Measures</h3>

<p>
  Here you will find your main tool for managing a pandemic.
  In the game, you can also choose to compensate for some measures &ndash;
  this means that you will spend special resources to compensate damaged businesses.
</p>

<p>
  In the game, for simplicity, the state is extremely effective in implementing and repealing measures.
  Everything is implemented almost immediately and always without technical errors.
  This is a major simplification compared to the real world.
  Remember that it takes some time for the measures to take effect on the number of people infected.
</p>

<p>
  <em>The measures slightly reduce the spread of the virus, but they also cost money and reduce stability in society.
  It's up to you what strategy you choose.
  We tried to make our model as fair as possible and allow for different approaches.
  For example, you can try to deploy and re-enable measures to avoid waves and hospital congestion.</em>
