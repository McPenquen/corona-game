  In the chart you can see the total number of dead and money spent.
  But that's not all the cost of a pandemic.
  <strong>
    During your game, pupils and students lost at least
    {{stats.schoolDaysLost.total}} teaching days
  </strong>.
  This outage will also occur
  most on groups that have a hard time with education already.

  To give you a better idea of what your financial costs mean?

  <li>Your pandemic costs: <strong>{{stats.costs.total}}</strong></li>

  Before viewing the results, we would like to warn you that the simulation captures only a fraction
  problems associated with the spread of coronavirus. There are many other questions posed by our simplified model
  does not capture: the long-term consequences of covid-19, the impact on people's psyches or how a pandemic will change the world in the future.

  In this, we hope that the game will serve as a springboard and motivation for further study.
  However, we would like to draw your attention to a few elements.
  We could legitimately say that your game got infected
  <strong>{{stats.detectedInfections.total}}</strong>
  but according to
  <a href="https://denikn.cz/471276/jaky-je-skutecny-rozsah-nakazy-sledujme-pocet-umrti-epidemie-se-zvrtla-uz-v-srpnu-upozoruji-vedci/"
    target="_blank">researchers' hypotheses</a> realistically up to
  <strong>{{estimateInfectionsTotal}}</strong> people (including recurrent infections).
  However, only infected logins (based on test data) are included in the game and your result.
