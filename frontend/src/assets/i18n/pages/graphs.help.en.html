<h3>Graphs</h3>

<p>
  The main source of current data on the situation in Czechia. You can switch between four graphs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>New infections</strong>
    It shows the number of new cases on a given day.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Casualties</strong>
    The number of casualties per day. This graph shows how many people died of Covid-19.
    However, there are other factors to keep in mind. For example, collapsing hospitals cause more deaths overall.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Costs</strong>
    The costs graph displays the losses caused by the pandemic to the state budget and the economy as a whole.
    Introducing measures, providing compensation, and hospitalising people all cost money.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Immunity</strong>
    This graph shows both citizens that gained immunity for a few months after going through Covid
    and people who became immune through vaccination.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <em>The graphs contain a lot of interesting information, but if you want to tackle the pandemic efficiently,
  we recommend focusing mainly on the new infections graph.
  That reflects how you are doing in handling the pandemic at a given moment.</em>
