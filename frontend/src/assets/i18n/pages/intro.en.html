  The simulation is based on a model described in the link below.
  It will let you step into the place of a government that must decide what mitigation measures to take.
  You will try out managing situations connected to the coronavirus epidemic and see the consequences of your decisions in detail.
  The simulation works for a European state with roughly 10 million citizens,
  which also determines some of its features (the public reacts negatively to restrictions and
  itâ€™s not possible to be completely closed off from the rest of the world).

  The game ends when either enough citizens become immune or the public gets so unhappy
  that your government falls. Everything else is up to you; you can decide what counts as an optimal strategy
  or a good result for you.
