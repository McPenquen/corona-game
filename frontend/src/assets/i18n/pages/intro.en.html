<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  You are in a simulation of the spread of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
</p>

<p>
  The simulation was based on a model you can learn more about in our document linked under this text.
  It will allow you to take on the role of government, which decides what anti-drug measures will be put in place.
  You'll try to address situations associated with coronavirus epidemics and you'll see the consequences of each step.
  The simulation is based on a state of about ten million in Europe,
  resulting in some specifics (for example, the public reacts negatively to restrictions
  and it is not possible to isolate yourself completely from the world).
</p>

<p>
  The game ends either because enough people in the state are immune or because society is so dissatisfied,
  that you can no longer rule. But everything else is up to you what you consider the optimal strategy
  and a good result is your decision.
